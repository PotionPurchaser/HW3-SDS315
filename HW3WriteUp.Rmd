## Question 1

### Theory A: Gas stations charge more if they lack direct competition in sight.

Claim: Gas stations without competitors charge higher prices compared to
those with competition.

Evidence:

Mean Prices:

-   Stations without competitors: \$1.876 per gallon

-   Stations with competitors: \$1.852 per gallon

![](hw3problem1theoryA.png)

Welch’s t-test result:

-   t = 1.4585, p-value = 0.148 (not statistically significant).

95% Confidence Interval: [-\$0.0085, \$0.0554].

![](hw3problem1theoryA2.png)

Interpretation: The mean price difference is very small. The confidence
interval includes 0, meaning that there is a likely chance that there
are no significant differences.

Conclusion: This theory is not supported. While gas stations without
competitors do charge slightly more, the difference is not statistically
significant (p \> 0.05).

### Theory B: The richer the area, the higher the gas prices.

Claim: Gas stations in higher-income ZIP codes charge higher prices for
gasoline.

Evidence:

-   Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.396 (moderate positive
    correlation).

-   Statistical Test Results: t = 4.29, p-value = 4.12e-5 (highly
    significant).

-   95% Confidence Interval for correlation: [0.218, 0.549].

![](hw3problem1theoryB1.png)

Interpretation: Higher median income is associated with higher gas
prices. However, the correlation is not the strongest which means other
factors also play a role.

Conclusion: This theory is supported. There is a moderate but
statistically significant positive correlation between income and gas
prices.

### Theory C: Gas stations at stoplights charge more.

Claim : Gas stations near stoplights charge higher prices due to
convenience.

Evidence:

Mean Prices:

-   Without stoplight: \$1.866 per gallon

-   With stoplight: \$1.863 per gallon

-   Welch’s t-test result: t = 0.187, p-value = 0.852 (not significant).

-   95% Confidence Interval: [-\$0.0319, \$0.0385].

![](hw3problem1theoryC1.png) ![](hw3problem1theoryC2.png)

Interpretation: The price difference is negligible (0.03 cents). The
confidence interval includes 0, indicating no meaningful effect.

Conclusion: This theory is not supported. Stoplight presence does not
significantly impact gas prices.

### Theory D: Gas stations with direct highway access charge more.

Claim: Gas stations with highway access charge higher prices, taking
advantage of convenience for drivers.

Evidence:

Mean Prices:

-   Without highway access: \$1.854 per gallon

-   With highway access: \$1.900 per gallon

Welch’s t-test result: t = -2.463, p-value = 0.0188 (statistically
significant).

95% Confidence Interval: [-\$0.0834, -\$0.0080].

![](hw3problem1theoryD1.png) ![](hw3problem1theoryD2.png)

Interpretation: Highway-access stations charge 4.6 cents more per
gallon. The confidence interval does not include 0, meaning the
difference is statistically significant.

Conclusion:

This theory is supported. Gas stations with highway access charge
significantly more, confirming that highway convenience allows for
higher pricing.

### Theory E: Shell charges more than all other non-Shell brands.

Claim: Shell charges higher prices than ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco, and
other brands.

Evidence:

ANOVA Test Result: F = 1.681, p-value = 0.176 (not significant). Mean
price differences between brands were small.

![](hw3problem1theoryE1.png) ![](hw3problem1theoryE2.png)

Interpretation: The ANOVA test shows no significant price difference
between brands. While Shell might charge more in specific cases, the
effect is not strong across all stations.

Conclusion: This theory is not supported. While Shell may have a
reputation for higher prices, the data does not show a statistically
significant difference among brands.

## Question 2:

### Part A:

Claim: The average mileage of 2011 Mercedes S-Class 63 AMG vehicles on
the used-car market falls within a specific range.

Evidence:

-   Bootstrap Sampling: The dataset contained 116 used 2011 S-Class 63
    AMG vehicles. A bootstrap resampling method (10,000 iterations) was
    used to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the average
    mileage.

Results:

-   Estimated mean mileage: Between 26,335 and 31,861 miles

-   95% Confidence Interval: (26,335, 31,861) miles

![](hw3problem2partA.png)

Interpretation: The confidence interval suggests that the true mean
mileage of 2011 S-Class 63 AMG vehicles is likely to be between 26,335
and 31,861 miles. The bootstrap method accounts for sample variability
which makes it a more reliable estimate than a single sample mean.

Conclusion: The estimated average mileage of 2011 S-Class 63 AMG
vehicles on the used-car market is between 26,335 and 31,861 miles, with
95% confidence. This means that if we repeatedly sampled vehicles, 95%
of the time, the true average mileage would fall within this range.

### Part B:

Claim: A specific proportion of 2014 Mercedes S-Class 550 vehicles on
the used-car market were painted black.

Evidence:

-   Binary Variable Creation: A new variable isBlack was created, where
    1 = Black, 0 = Not Black. The dataset contained 2,889 used 2014
    S-Class 550 vehicles.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Bootstrap Sampling: A bootstrap resampling method (10,000
    iterations) was applied to estimate the proportion of black cars.

Results:

-   Observed proportion of black cars: Between 41.68% and 45.28%

-   95% Confidence Interval: (0.4168, 0.4528)

![](hw3problem2partB.png)

Interpretation: The confidence interval suggests that between 41.68% and
45.28% of all 2014 S-Class 550 vehicles were black in the used-car
market. A narrow confidence interval suggests greater precision in
estimating the true proportion.

Conclusion: The estimated proportion of black 2014 S-Class 550s in the
used-car market is between 41.68% and 45.28% with 95% confidence. This
means that if we were to sample another set of vehicles, we would expect
the true proportion of black S-Class 550s to fall within this range.

## Question 3

### Part A:

1)  Question Does Living with Ed or My Name is Earl generate higher
    viewer happiness ratings?

2)  Approach Statistical Test:

    A Welch’s t-test was used to compare the mean Q1_Happy ratings
    between the two shows.

    Graphical Analysis: A boxplot was created to visualize the happiness
    rating distributions.

3)  Results:

    Mean Happiness Ratings:

    -   Living with Ed: 3.93

    -   My Name is Earl: 3.78

        Welch’s t-test result: t = 1.168, p-value = 0.2447 (not
        statistically significant).

        95% Confidence Interval: (-0.103, 0.401)

![](hw3problem3partA.png)

Interpretation: The confidence interval suggests that the true
difference in mean happiness ratings is likely between -0.103 and 0.401.
Since the confidence interval includes 0 and the p-value is greater than
0.05, there is no strong statistical evidence to conclude that one show
makes people significantly happier than the other.

4\. Conclusion: The data suggests that there is no significant
difference in happiness ratings between Living with Ed and My Name is
Earl. Living with Ed has a slightly higher mean rating, but the
difference is not statistically significant, meaning it may have
occurred by chance.

### Part B

1)  Question: Do viewers find The Biggest Loser or The Apprentice: Los
    Angeles more annoying?

2)  Approach Statistical Test:

    A Welch’s t-test was used to compare the mean Q1_Annoyed ratings
    between the two shows.

    Graphical Analysis: A boxplot was used to show differences in
    annoyance ratings.

3)  Results:

    Mean Annoyance Ratings:

    The Apprentice: Los Angeles: 2.31

    The Biggest Loser: 2.04

    Welch’s t-test result: t = 2.103, p-value = 0.0363 (statistically
    significant).

    95% Confidence Interval: (0.017, 0.525)

![](hw3problem3partB.png)

Interpretation: The confidence interval suggests that the true
difference in mean annoyance ratings is likely between 0.017 and 0.525.
Since the confidence interval does not include 0 and the p-value is
below 0.05, the difference is statistically significant, meaning The
Apprentice: Los Angeles was rated as more annoying than The Biggest
Loser with high confidence.

4\. Conclusion: The data suggests that The Apprentice: Los Angeles was
significantly more annoying to viewers than The Biggest Loser. Since the
confidence interval does not include 0, we can conclude that the
difference is statistically meaningful rather than due to random
variation.

### Part C:

1)  Question What proportion of viewers found Dancing with the Stars
    confusing (gave a rating of 4 or 5 on Q2_Confusing)?

2)  Approach:

    -   Binary Variable Creation: Defined a new variable isConfused (1 =
        rating ≥4, 0 = rating ≤3).

    -   Statistical Tool: Used bootstrap resampling (10,000 iterations)
        to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of
        confused viewers.

3)  Results Observed Proportion of Confused Viewers:

    -   Between 3.87% and 11.60% 95%

    -   Confidence Interval: (0.0387, 0.1160)

![](hw3problem3partC.png)

Interpretation: The confidence interval suggests that the true
proportion of confused viewers is likely between 3.87% and 11.60%. This
means that a small but notable percentage of viewers found the show
confusing.

4.Conclusion: Between 3.87% and 11.60% of viewers found Dancing with the
Stars confusing. While this is a minority of the audience, it suggests
that the show’s format may be unclear or difficult to follow for some
viewers.

## Question 4:

Question: Does turning off Google AdWords advertising impact eBay’s
revenue? Specifically, does the revenue ratio (after/before revenue)
differ significantly between the treatment group (ads paused) and the
control group (ads continued)?

![](hw3problem4picture1.png)

Approach:

Statistical Test Used:

-   Bootstrap resampling (10,000 Monte Carlo simulations) was performed
    to compute a 95% confidence interval for the difference in revenue
    ratios between the treatment and control groups.

-   Revenue Ratio Definition: Revenue Ratio = Revenue After / Revenue
    Before (for each DMA). If paid search ads drive extra revenue, the
    control group (where ads continued) should have a higher revenue
    ratio than the treatment group (where ads were paused).

-   Comparison Metric: The difference in mean revenue ratios between
    treatment and control groups was analyzed.

Results:

-   95% Bootstrap Confidence Interval for Difference in Revenue Ratios:
    (-0.0916, -0.0136).

![](hw3problem4picture2.png)

Interpretation: Since the entire confidence interval is negative, this
indicates that the treatment group (ads paused) had a lower revenue
ratio compared to the control group (ads continued). The difference is
statistically significant because the confidence interval does not
include 0, meaning the effect is unlikely to be due to chance. The
negative effect size suggests that stopping paid search ads led to a
revenue decrease.

Conclusion:

The data supports the hypothesis that paid Google AdWords advertising
increases eBay’s revenue. Since the 95% confidence interval for the
revenue ratio difference is entirely negative (-0.0916, -0.0136), we can
conclude that pausing ads led to a statistically significant revenue
decline. This suggests that paid search advertising is beneficial for
eBay's revenue generation, and cutting off these ads reduces revenue.
